The Event Management System has been developed with the following scope:
1.	Registration Management: The system allows for efficient registration of attendees for different events. It captures essential information such as attendee names and email addresses, ensuring complete participant records.
2.	Capacity Control: The system implements capacity limitations (currently set at 100 attendees per event) and prevents over-registration, maintaining event management best practices.
3.	Data Persistence: Through file handling mechanisms, the system ensures that all registration data is stored persistently, allowing for retrieval across different sessions and providing a reliable record of event participation.
4.	Reporting Capabilities: The system offers various reporting features, including:
o	Individual event attendee lists
o	Comprehensive attendee information across all events
o	Total registration counts
5.	Venue Management: The system includes functionality to assess venue availability based on attendance metrics, aiding in logistical planning.
6.	User Interface: A straightforward console-based interface provides easy access to all system functionalities, with clear menu options and guided interaction flows.
7.	Data Security: The system implements appropriate data validation and error handling to ensure the integrity of stored information.
8.	Extensibility: The object-oriented design allows for easy extension to accommodate additional event types or enhanced functionalities in future iterations.
